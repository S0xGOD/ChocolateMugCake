In a microwaveable mug mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt with a fork.
Add in the milk, oil, egg & chocolate chips and whisk until you have a smooth cake batter.
Microwave your cake for roughly 45 seconds to 1 minute or until the cake has risen and is firm to the touch. Take care not to overcook as it will toughen the cake. (The timing is based on my microwave which is 1200 WATTS so check the wattage of your microwave because your timing may vary.)
Once cooked, top with a little fudge frosting, whipped cream or ice-cream, some sprinkles, and enjoy!!
